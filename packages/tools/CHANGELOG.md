# @sapiom/tools

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 2126d96: `repositories.pushFromSandbox` now always publishes the agent's work — it
  commits any pending changes and pushes the current commit, so your work reaches
  the repo whether the agent left changes uncommitted, already committed them, or
  both. (Previously it skipped the push when there were no uncommitted changes.)
  The result now includes `branch` alongside `pushed` and `sha`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- be3886e: Add the dispatch→pause→resume authoring surface for long-running capabilities.

  `@sapiom/tools`: new `DispatchHandle` contract + `CODING_RESULT_SIGNAL`; coding-run
  handles now carry a `dispatch` member, and `launch` forwards the engine-injected
  `SAPIOM_CAPABILITY_RESUME_TOKEN` as the `x-sapiom-workflow-token` header.

  `@sapiom/orchestration`: `pauseUntilSignal` accepts a `DispatchHandle |
Promise<DispatchHandle>` so a step can pause on a launched capability with
  `pauseUntilSignal(ctx.sapiom.agent.coding.launch(...), { resumeStep })`.

  Additive and non-breaking — standalone `agent.coding.launch` is unchanged.
