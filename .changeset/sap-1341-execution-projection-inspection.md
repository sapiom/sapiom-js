Bring `inspect()` / `listExecutions()` to REST `ExecutionProjection` parity (tree + per-node cost + trace refs), replacing the flat inspection shape.

**Breaking (return shapes):**

- `inspect(opts, client)` now resolves the decoded `ExecutionProjection` **directly** (previously `{ execution }`). It carries the dispatch tree (`traceRoot`/`traceParent`/`traceId`/`spanId`, `parentExecutionId`/`rootExecutionId`, typed `children`), per-step `spanId`/`events`/`dispatch`, and a structured `StepError` (`trace` is now a `StepErrorTrace` of source-mapped frames, not a string).
- `listExecutions(client)` now resolves `ExecutionRef[]` **directly** (previously `{ executions }`).
- The flat `ExecutionDetail` / `StepRecord` types are removed; import the new projection types (`ExecutionProjection`, `StepProjection`, `CostNode`, `ExecutionRef`, `DispatchRef`, `StepError`, `StepEvent`) instead.

**Cost is honest, never fabricated:** `cost` is `CostNode | null` at run and step granularity. The execution-detail read is cost-agnostic today (authoritative cost lives at `/executions/:id/spend`), so an absent cost decodes to `null`, not a misleading `$0`. `authorizedUsd`/`capturedUsd`/`settleState` are never collapsed when cost is present.

The engine must emit the corresponding fields (per-node cost, list lineage, named child edges) for the projection to be fully populated; until then `inspect()`/`listExecutions()` degrade honestly rather than throwing. SDK pins move in lockstep with the engine.
